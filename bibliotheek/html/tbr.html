                    Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse.
                    By age twenty, in fact she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she's thrown her life away.
                    But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world's most elite universitiets on a full ride. What's the catch, and why her?<br>
                    Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale's secret societies.
                    Theseeight windowless 'tombs' are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood's biggest players. 
                    But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imigination might conceive.

                    She'll do whatever it takes, collecting her own sidekicks, and leveraging the two most infamous EOs, Victor Vale and Eli Ever, against each other.<br>

                    Trained from birth to return to the place of her parents' murder and usurp the only survivor, she will do anything to rise to power and protect the community of witches she loves. 
                    Or she would, if only a certain palace guard wasn't quite so distractingly attractive, and if her reckless magic didn't have a habit of causing trouble...<br>
                    Princess Rose Valhart knows that with power comes responsibility. 
                    Marriage into a brutal kingdom awaits, and she will not let a small matter like waking up in the middle of the desert in the company of an extremely impertinent (and handsome) kidnapper get in the way of her royal duty. 
                    But life outside the palace walls is wilder and more beautiful than she ever imagined, and the witches she has long feared might turn out to be the family she never knew she was missing.<br>
                    Two sisters separated at birth and raised into entirely different worlds are about to get to know each other's lives a whole lot better. 
                    But as coronation day looms closer and they each strive to claim their birthright, the sinister Kingsbreath, Willem Rathborne, becomes increasingly determined that neither will succeed. 
                    Who will ultimately rise to power and wear the crown?</td>

                    Now I'm here, a prisoner of Fourth Kingdom's army, and I'm not sure if I'm going to make it out of this in one piece. 
                    They're marching to battle, and I'm the bargaining chip that will either douse the fire or spark a war.
                    At the heart of my fear, my worry, there's him—Commander Rip.
                    Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.
                    Fae.
                    The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. 
                    Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine. But his eyes—his eyes are the most compelling of all.
                    When he turns those black eyes on me, I feel captive for an entirely different reason.
                    I may be out of my cage, but I'm not free, not even close. In the game of kings and armies, I'm the gilded pawn. The question is, can I out maneuver them?</td>

                    The thing about being confined is that you believe it's to keep the bad out... Until you realize it's about keeping you in.
                    I'm now in a strange kingdom surrounded by liars, with no allies of my own, but I won't sit idly by and let myself wither. 
                    No, there's something that's bloomed from the pit of my repression. Something dark. Something angry.
                    But the last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.
                    He's sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I've learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he's near? 
                    I need to tread carefully, or I'm at risk of losing much more than just my freedom.
                    Regret and revenge war inside of me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.
                    Because I won't be caught in a cage again. No, this time, It'll be me setting the trap... I just hope my heart comes out of this unscathed.</td>

                    Like a phoenix caught fire, I will need to rise from the ashes and learn to wield my own power. 
                    Because my wings may have been clipped, but I am not in a cage, and I'm finally free to fly from the frozen kingdoms I've been kept in.
                    Yet the world doesn't want to let me.
                    That's the thing when you turn against a king—everyone else turns against you.
                    Good thing I have a different king in my corner.
                    But even with the dark threat of Slade Ravinger, the other monarchs are coming for me.
                    So I will fight for him and he will kill for me, and if we need to become the villains, then so be it.
                    Because so long as I live in this world, I won't be used again.</td>
