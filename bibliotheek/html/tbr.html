                    Trained from birth to return to the place of her parents' murder and usurp the only survivor, she will do anything to rise to power and protect the community of witches she loves. 
                    Or she would, if only a certain palace guard wasn't quite so distractingly attractive, and if her reckless magic didn't have a habit of causing trouble...<br>
                    Princess Rose Valhart knows that with power comes responsibility. 
                    Marriage into a brutal kingdom awaits, and she will not let a small matter like waking up in the middle of the desert in the company of an extremely impertinent (and handsome) kidnapper get in the way of her royal duty. 
                    But life outside the palace walls is wilder and more beautiful than she ever imagined, and the witches she has long feared might turn out to be the family she never knew she was missing.<br>
                    Two sisters separated at birth and raised into entirely different worlds are about to get to know each other's lives a whole lot better. 
                    But as coronation day looms closer and they each strive to claim their birthright, the sinister Kingsbreath, Willem Rathborne, becomes increasingly determined that neither will succeed.

                    Now I'm here, a prisoner of Fourth Kingdom's army, and I'm not sure if I'm going to make it out of this in one piece. 
                    They're marching to battle, and I'm the bargaining chip that will either douse the fire or spark a war.

                    Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.

                    The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. 
                    Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine. But his eyes—his eyes are the most compelling of all.
                    When he turns those black eyes on me, I feel captive for an entirely different reason.
                    I may be out of my cage, but I'm not free, not even close. In the game of kings and armies, I'm the gilded pawn. The question is, can I out maneuver them?</td>

                    He's sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I've learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he's near? 
                    I need to tread carefully, or I'm at risk of losing much more than just my freedom.
                    Regret and revenge war inside of me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.
                    Because I won't be caught in a cage again. No, this time, It'll be me setting the trap... I just hope my heart comes out of this unscathed.</td>

                    In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. 
                    But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. 
                    As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.
                    Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. 
                    But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.
                    Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. 
                    There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, will face his greatest challenge. 
                    For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.
                    From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. 
                    Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.</td>
