    <h1 class="mijn-boekenh1">Mijn bibliotheek</h1>

    <p>Officieel gesproken mag je boekenkasten met boeken thuis pas een bibliotheek noemen wanneer je 1000 boeken hebt thuis hebt.
        Ik vind het alleen gewoon leuker om mijn boeken een bibliotheek te noemen, mijn moeder leent ook boeken van mij en ik van haar,
        dus dat ik ook eigenlijk een bibliotheek. Mijn moeder en ik hebben wel samen een bibliotheek samen. Hieronder staan al mijn boeken die ik heb.

                        But when you're smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don't bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.

                        The thing about being confined is that you believe it's to keep the bad out... Until you realize it's about keeping you in.
                        I'm now in a strange kingdom surrounded by liars, with no allies of my own, but I won't sit idly by and let myself wither.

                        But the last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.
                        He's sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I've learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he's near? 
                        I need to tread carefully, or I'm at risk of losing much more than just my freedom.
                        Regret and revenge war inside of me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.
                        Because I won't be caught in a cage again. No, this time, It'll be me setting the trap... I just hope my heart comes out of this unscathed.</td>

                        Hidden deep in the mountains of Colorado lies the Inn at Havenfall, a sanctuary that connects ancient worlds—each with its own magic. 
                        For generations, the inn has protected all who seek refuge within its walls, and any who disrupt the peace can never return.
                        For Maddie Morrow, summers at the inn are more than a chance to experience this magic firsthand. Havenfall is an escape from reality, where her mother sits on death row accused of murdering Maddie's brother. 
                        It's where Maddie fell in love with handsome Fiorden soldier Brekken. And it's where one day she hopes to inherit the role of Innkeeper from her beloved uncle.
                        But this summer, the impossible happens—a dead body is found, shattering everything the inn stands for. 
                        With Brekken missing, her uncle gravely injured, and a dangerous creature on the loose, Maddie suddenly finds herself responsible for the safety of everyone in Havenfall. 
                        She'll do anything to uncover the truth, even if it means working together with an alluring new staffer, Taya, who seems to know more than she's letting on. 
                        As dark secrets are revealed about the inn itself, one thing becomes clear to Maddie—no one can be trusted, and no one is safe...</td>

                    <td>A spellbinding middle grade fantasy about three sisters--adventurous Betty, curious Charlie, and proper Fliss--who go on a quest to break the curse that's haunted their family for generations.
                        All Betty Widdershins wants is an adventure--one that takes her far away from Crowstone, the gloomy island where she's always lived. 
                        But instead of an adventure, Betty and her sisters, Fliss and Charlie, are given of a set of magical objects, each with its own powers: 
                        a scruffy carpet bag, a set of wooden nesting dolls, and a gilt-framed mirror. 
                        And these magical objects come with their own terrible secret: the sisters' family is haunted by a generations-long curse that prevents them from ever leaving their island--at the cost of death.
                        The sisters set out to break the curse and free their family forever. But after stumbling upon a mysterious prisoner who claims to be able to help them, they find themselves in great danger. 
                        And in order to break the curse--and stay alive--they must unravel a mystery that goes back centuries, one that involves shipwrecks, smugglers, and sorcery of the most perilous kind.</td>

                        Surely it must be a coincidence that this happened just as Nathaniel and Elisabeth started getting closer to one another...

                        With no access to the outside world, Elisabeth, Nathaniel, and Silas - along with their new maid Mercy - will have to work together to discover the source of the magic behind the malfunctioning wards before they're due to host the city's Midwinter Ball. 
                        Not an easy task when the house is filled with unexpected secrets, and all Elisabeth can think about is kissing Nathaniel in peace. 
                        But when it becomes clear that the house, influenced by the magic of Nathaniel's ancestors, requires a price for its obedience, Elisabeth and Nathaniel will have to lean on their connection like never before to set things right.</td>

                        At the heart of it all is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang—a network of criminals far above the law. 
                        Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette's first love…and first betrayal.
                        But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. 
                        Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. 
                        As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns—and grudges—aside and work together, for if they can't stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.</td>

                        But it turns out surviving a murderous Witch Hunter doesn't exactly qualify as a summer vacation, and now the rest of the Hunters seem more intent on destroying her magic than ever.
                        When Hannah learns the Hunters have gone nationwide, armed with a serum capable of taking out entire covens at once, she's desperate to help. 
                        Now, with witches across the country losing the most important thing they have—their power—Hannah could be their best shot at finally defeating the Hunters.

                        Or so everyone believes. Because as good as she is at faking it, doing even the smallest bit of magic leaves her in agony. 
                        The only person who can bring her comfort, who can make her power flourish, is Morgan. But Morgan's magic is on the line, too, and if Hannah can't figure out how to save her—and the rest of the Witches—she'll lose everything she's ever known. 
                        And as the Hunters get dangerously close to their final target, will all the Witches in Salem be enough to stop an enemy determined to destroy magic for good?</td>

                        to the test officials, who couldn't believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin's guardians, who believed they'd finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise;

                        That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren't always good.
                        Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. 
                        Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. 
                        Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.

                        For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.
                        From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. 
                        Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.</td>

                        Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped.

                        All at the exact moment of Stevie's greatest triumph . . . She knows who Truly Devious is. She's solved it. The greatest case of the century.
                        At least, she thinks she has. With this latest tragedy, it's hard to concentrate on the past. 
                        Not only has someone died in town, but David disappeared of his own free will and is up to something. 
                        Stevie is sure that somehow—somehow—all these things connect. The three deaths in the present. The deaths in the past. 
                        The missing Alice Ellingham and the missing David Eastman. Somewhere in this place of riddles and puzzles there must be answers.
                        Then another accident occurs as a massive storm heads toward Vermont. This is too much for the parents and administrators. 
                        Ellingham Academy is evacuated. Obviously, it's time for Stevie to do something stupid. It's time to stay on the mountain and face the storm—and a murderer.</td>

                    <td>Amateur sleuth Stevie Bell needs a good murder. After catching a killer at her high school, she's back at home for a normal (that means boring) summer.
                        But then she gets a message from the owner of Sunny Pines, formerly known as Camp Wonder Falls—the site of the notorious unsolved case, the Box in the Woods Murders. 
                        Back in 1978, four camp counselors were killed in the woods outside of the town of Barlow Corners, their bodies left in a gruesome display. 
                        The new owner offers Stevie an invitation: Come to the camp and help him work on a true crime podcast about the case.
                        Stevie agrees, as long as she can bring along her friends from Ellingham Academy. Nothing sounds better than a summer spent together, investigating old murders.
                        But something evil still lurks in Barlow Corners. When Stevie opens the lid on this long-dormant case, she gets much more than she bargained for. 
                        The Box in the Woods will make room for more victims. This time, Stevie may not make it out alive.</td>

                        The case was assumed to be a burglary gone wrong, but one of the remaining seven saw something she can't explain. This was no break-in. Someone's lying about what happened in the woodshed.
