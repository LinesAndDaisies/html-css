    <h1 class="mijn-boekenh1">Mijn bibliotheek</h1>

    <p>Officieel gesproken mag je boekenkasten met boeken thuis pas een bibliotheek noemen wanneer je 1000 boeken hebt thuis hebt.
        Ik vind het alleen gewoon leuker om mijn boeken een bibliotheek te noemen, mijn moeder leent ook boeken van mij en ik van haar,
        dus dat ik ook eigenlijk een bibliotheek. Mijn moeder en ik hebben wel samen een bibliotheek samen. Hieronder staan al mijn boeken die ik heb.

                        But when you're smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don't bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.

                        Now I'm here, a prisoner of Fourth Kingdom's army, and I'm not sure if I'm going to make it out of this in one piece. 
                        They're marching to battle, and I'm the bargaining chip that will either douse the fire or spark a war.

                        If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?
                        TO BE IRREVOCABLY IN LOVE WITH A VAMPIRE is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. 
                        Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. 
                        Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.
                        NOW THAT BELLA HAS MADE HER DECISION, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. 
                        Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in New Moon and Eclipse - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</td>

                        The word of a Shadowhunter is a solemn pledge, and no vow is more sacred than the vow that binds parabatai, warrior partners—sworn to fight together, die together, but never to fall in love.
                        Emma Carstairs has learned that the love she shares with her parabatai, Julian Blackthorn, isn't just forbidden—it could destroy them both. 
                        She knows she should run from Julian. But how can she when the Blackthorns are threatened by enemies on all sides?
                        Their only hope is the Black Volume of the Dead, a spell book of terrible power. Everyone wants it. Only the Blackthorns can find it. 
                        Spurred on by a dark bargain with the Seelie Queen, Emma; her best friend, Cristina; and Mark and Julian Blackthorn journey into the Courts of Faerie, where glittering revels hide bloody danger and no promise can be trusted. 
                        Meanwhile, rising tension between Shadowhunters and Downworlders has produced the Cohort, an extremist group of Shadowhunters dedicated to registering Downworlders and “unsuitable” Nephilim. 
                        They'll do anything in their power to expose Julian's secrets and take the Los Angeles Institute for their own.
                        When Downworlders turn against the Clave, a new threat rises in the form of the Lord of Shadows—the Unseelie King, who sends his greatest warriors to slaughter those with Blackthorn blood and seize the Black Volume. 
                        As dangers close in, Julian devises a risky scheme that depends on the cooperation of an unpredictable enemy. 
                        But success may come with a price he and Emma cannot even imagine, one that will bring with it a reckoning of blood that could have repercussions for everyone and everything they hold dear.</td>

                        Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer's Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. 
                        If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.

                        As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she's been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself.

                        What force could Isobel's paintings conjure that is powerful enough to defy the ancient malice of the fairy courts?
                        Isobel and Rook journey along a knife-edge in a lush world where beauty masks corruption and the cost of survival might be more frightening than death itself.</td>

                        But even though she lives in Salem, Massachusetts, her magic is a secret she has to keep to herself. 
                        If she's ever caught using it in front of a Reg (read: non-witch), she could lose it. 
                        For good. So, Hannah spends most of her time avoiding her ex-girlfriend (and fellow Elemental Witch) Veronica, hanging out with her best friend, and working at the Fly by Night Cauldron selling candles and crystals to tourists, goths, and local Wiccans.
                        But dealing with her ex is the least of Hannah's concerns when a terrifying blood ritual interrupts the end-of-school-year bonfire. 
                        Evidence of dark magic begins to appear all over Salem, and Hannah's sure it's the work of a deadly Blood Witch. 
                        The issue is, her coven is less than convinced, forcing Hannah to team up with the last person she wants to see: Veronica.
                        While the pair attempt to smoke out the Blood Witch at a house party, Hannah meets Morgan, a cute new ballerina in town. 
                        But trying to date amid a supernatural crisis is easier said than done, and Hannah will have to test the limits of her power if she's going to save her coven and get the girl, especially when the attacks on Salem's witches become deadlier by the day.</td>

                        When Hannah learns the Hunters have gone nationwide, armed with a serum capable of taking out entire covens at once, she's desperate to help. 
                        Now, with witches across the country losing the most important thing they have—their power—Hannah could be their best shot at finally defeating the Hunters.

                        And as the Hunters get dangerously close to their final target, will all the Witches in Salem be enough to stop an enemy determined to destroy magic for good?</td>

                        When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: 
                        to the test officials, who couldn't believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin's guardians, who believed they'd finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; 
                        and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. 
                        That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren't always good.
                        Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. 
                        Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. 
                        Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.
                        For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. 
                        The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. 
                        And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .
                        Rin's shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . .

                        But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. 
                        As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.
                        Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. 
                        But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.

                        For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.
                        From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. 
                        Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.</td>

                        And while she solved that murder, the crimes of the past are still waiting in the dark. 
                        Just as Stevie feels she's on the cusp of putting it together, her parents pull her out of Ellingham academy.
                        For her own safety they say. She must move past this obsession with crime. Now that Stevie's away from the school of topiaries and secret tunnels, 
                        and her strange and endearing friends, she begins to feel disconnected from the rest of the world. At least she won't have to see David anymore. 
                        David, who she kissed. David, who lied to her about his identity—son of despised politician Edward King. Then King himself arrives at her house to offer a deal: 
                        He will bring Stevie back to Ellingham immediately. In return, she must play nice with David. King is in the midst of a campaign and can't afford his son stirring up trouble. 
                        If Stevie's at school, David will stay put.
                        The tantalizing riddles behind the Ellingham murders are still waiting to be unraveled, and Stevie knows she's so close. 
                        But the path to the truth has more twists and turns than she can imagine—and moving forward involves hurting someone she cares for. 
                        In New York Times bestselling author Maureen Johnson's second novel of the Truly Devious series, nothing is free, and someone will pay for the truth with their life.</td>

                        a brilliant, all-consuming read that marks the explosive debut of an extraordinary new writer.
                        2000. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, 
                        her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher.
                        2017. Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, 
                        who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, 
                        firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. 
                        But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? 
                        Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?
                        Alternating between Vanessa's present and her past, My Dark Vanessa juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. 
                        Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood.</td>

                        Hardin will always be… Hardin. But is he really the deep, thoughtful guy Tessa fell madly in love with despite his angry exterior—or has he been a stranger all along? 
                        She wishes she could walk away. It's just not that easy. Not with the memory of passionate nights spent in his arms. His electric touch. His hungry kisses.
                        Still, Tessa's not sure she can endure one more broken promise. She put so much on hold for Hardin—school, 
                        friends, her mom, a relationship with a guy who really loved her, and now possibly even a promising new career. She needs to move forward with her life.

                        throw everything they knew before in doubt and makes their hard-won future together more difficult to claim.
                        Tessa's life begins to come unglued. Nothing is what she thought it was. Not her friends. Not her family. 
                        The one person she should be able to rely on, Hardin, is furious when he discovers the massive secret she's been keeping. And rather than being understanding, he turns to sabotage.
                        Tessa knows Hardin loves her and will do anything to protect her, but there's a difference between loving someone and being able to have them in your life. 
                        This cycle of jealousy, unpredictable anger, and forgiveness is exhausting. She's never felt so intensely for anyone, so exhilarated by someone's kiss—but is the irrepressible heat between her and Hardin worth all the drama? 
                        Love used to be enough to hold them together. But if Tessa follows her heart now, will it be...the end?</td>

                        Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.
                        As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. 
                        He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</td>

                    <td>Malibu: August, 1983. It's the day of Nina Riva's annual end-of-summer party, and anticipation is at a fever pitch. 
                        Everyone wants to be around the famous Rivas: Nina, the talented surfer and supermodel; brothers Jay and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other a renowned photographer; and their adored baby sister, Kit. 
                        Together, the siblings are a source of fascination in Malibu and the world over—especially as the offspring of the legendary singer, Mick Riva.
                        The only person not looking forward to the party of the year is Nina herself, who never wanted to be the center of attention, and who has also just been very publicly abandoned by her pro tennis player husband. 
                        Oh, and maybe Hud—because it is long past time to confess something to the brother from whom he's been inseparable since birth.
                        Jay, on the other hand, is counting the minutes until nightfall, when the girl he can't stop thinking about promised she'll be there.
                        And Kit has a couple secrets of her own—including a guest she invited without consulting anyone.
                        By midnight the party will be completely out of control. By morning, the Riva mansion will have gone up in flames. 
                        But before that first spark in the early hours before dawn, the alcohol will flow, the music will play, and the loves and secrets that shaped this family's generations will all come bubbling to the surface.</td>

                        Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters' trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, 
                        who she's convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, 
                        Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they've met many times and it's never been cute.

                        Thinking I was a girl, with a name like Misha, the other teacher paired me up with her student, Ryen. My teacher, believing Ryen was a boy like me, agreed.
                        It didn't take long for us to figure out the mistake. And in no time at all, we were arguing about everything. The best take-out pizza.

                        Ryen: He hasn't written in three months. Something's wrong. Did he die? Get arrested? Knowing Misha, neither would be a stretch.
                        Without him around, I'm going crazy. I need to know someone is listening. It's my own fault. I should've gotten his number or picture or something.
                        He could be gone forever. Or right under my nose, and I wouldn't even know it.</td>

                        Socially anxious high school student Shoko Komi's greatest dream is to make some friends, but everyone at school mistakes her crippling social anxiety for cool reserve! 
                        With the whole student body keeping their distance and Komi unable to utter a single word, friendship might be forever beyond her reach.
                        Najimi's sudden declaration of a Christmas Eve party at Komi's house sends the friends into a flurry of last-minute gift shopping and Komi into a fit of worrying. 
                        But when her friends all turn up with good cheer and a giant stuffed animal for her, it turns out Najimi wasn't just being impulsive—there's a special surprise for Komi too!</td>
