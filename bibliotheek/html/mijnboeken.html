    <h1 class="mijn-boekenh1">Mijn bibliotheek</h1>

    <p>Officieel gesproken mag je boekenkasten met boeken thuis pas een bibliotheek noemen wanneer je 1000 boeken hebt thuis hebt.
        Ik vind het alleen gewoon leuker om mijn boeken een bibliotheek te noemen, mijn moeder leent ook boeken van mij en ik van haar,
        dus dat ik ook eigenlijk een bibliotheek. Mijn moeder en ik hebben wel samen een bibliotheek samen. Hieronder staan al mijn boeken die ik heb.

                            Elowen Atarah, Princess of Imirath, came into the world like a firestorm made flesh. 
                            A princess with a link to five dragons should have been a blessing to her kingdom, but her blessing became her curse. 
                            The little girl in shackles became a knife wielding woman with a thirst for retaliation.
                            Now, Queen of Aestilian, a secret kingdom she forged through strength and survival, Elowen needs a way to feed her rising population. 
                            She never thought she would have the force to take on Imirath, but when the snarky Commander Cayden Veles of Vareveth, her father's enemy kingdom, offers her a deal she's been dreaming of for years, how can she not take it? 
                            Even if he ignites her temper like no other, nothing unites two begrudging allies more than a common enemy.
                            The pair of them, along with three accomplices, will navigate their partnership, politics, and attempt to pull off the greatest heist their world has ever known. 
                            Five people, all united through revenge, will have to transcend the odds stacked against them and infiltrate “The Impenetrable Castle” if they want to reap their rewards before someone reaps their souls. 
                            Putting aside their differences to accomplish a common goal because everyone knows…vengeance is a promise signed in blood.</td>

                        Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.
                        Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . 
                        and the secrets of her heart.</td>

                            If Charlotte loses her position, Tessa will be out on the street—and easy prey for the mysterious Magister, who wants to use Tessa's powers for his own dark ends.
                            With the help of the handsome, self-destructive Will and the fiercely devoted Jem, Tessa discovers that the Magister's war on the Shadowhunters is deeply personal. 
                            He blames them for a long-ago tragedy that shattered his life. To unravel the secrets of the past, the trio journeys from mist-shrouded Yorkshire to a manor house that holds untold horrors,

                        They're living together in a fabulous loft, their warlock son, Max, has started learning to walk, and the streets of New York are peaceful and quiet—as peaceful and quiet as they ever are, anyway.
                        Until the night that two old acquaintances break into Magnus's apartment and steal the powerful Book of the White. 
                        Now Magnus and Alec will have to drop everything to get it back. 
                        They need to follow the thieves to Shanghai, they need to call some backup to accompany them, and they need a babysitter.
                        Also, someone has stabbed Magnus with a strange magical weapon and the wound is glowing, so they have that to worry about too.
                        Fortunately, their backup consists of Clary, Jace, Isabelle, and newly minted Shadowhunter Simon. 
                        In Shanghai, they learn that a much darker threat awaits them. Magnus's magic is growing unstable, and if they can't stop the demons flooding into the city, 
                        they might have to follow them all the way back to the source—to the very realm of the dead. 
                        Can they stop the threat to the world? Will they make it back home before their kid completely wears out Alec's mom?</td>

                        It will take every ounce of strength Shiori can muster to defend the life and the love she's fought so hard to win.</td>

                        When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: 
                        to the test officials, who couldn't believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin's guardians, who believed they'd finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; 
                        and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. 
                        That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren't always good.
                        Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. 
                        Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. 
                        Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.
                        For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. 
                        The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. 
                        And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .
                        Rin's shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . .

                            When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. 
                            But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station's wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. 
                            Soon Hanna and Nik aren't just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the Hypatia—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.
                            But relax. They've totally got this. They hope.</td>

                            But as it turns out, not all endings are endings, and the team has one last chance to rewrite theirs. Maybe two. It's complicated.

                        She's not sure what she will find—her cousin's husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.
                        Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She's a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. 
                        But she's also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin's new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, 
                        the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemí's dreams with visions of blood and doom.

                        For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place. The family's once colossal wealth and faded mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as Noemí digs deeper she unearths stories of violence and madness.</td>

                            Meddy is hesitant at first, but she hits it off right away with the wedding photographer, Staphanie, who reminds Meddy of herself, down to the unfortunately misspelled name.

                        It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. “A place,” he said, “where learning is a game.”
                        Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. 
                        The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym “Truly, Devious.” 
                        It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history.
                        True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: 
                        She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates:

                        But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies.

                        2000. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, 
                        her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher.
                        2017. Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, 
                        who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, 
                        firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. 
                        But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? 
                        Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?
                        Alternating between Vanessa's present and her past, My Dark Vanessa juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. 
                        Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood.</td>

                        After a tumultuous beginning to their relationship, Tessa and Hardin were on the path to making things work. 
                        Tessa knew Hardin could be cruel, but when a bombshell revelation is dropped about the origins of their relationship—and Hardin's mysterious past—Tessa is beside herself.
                        Hardin will always be… Hardin. But is he really the deep, thoughtful guy Tessa fell madly in love with despite his angry exterior—or has he been a stranger all along? 
                        She wishes she could walk away. It's just not that easy. Not with the memory of passionate nights spent in his arms. His electric touch. His hungry kisses.
                        Still, Tessa's not sure she can endure one more broken promise. She put so much on hold for Hardin—school, 
                        friends, her mom, a relationship with a guy who really loved her, and now possibly even a promising new career. She needs to move forward with her life.
                        Hardin knows he made a mistake, possibly the biggest one of his life. He's not going down without a fight. But can he change? Will he change for love?</td>

                            Just as Tessa makes the biggest decision of her life, everything changes. Revelations about first her family, and then Hardin's, 
                            throw everything they knew before in doubt and makes their hard-won future together more difficult to claim.
                            Tessa's life begins to come unglued. Nothing is what she thought it was. Not her friends. Not her family. 
                            The one person she should be able to rely on, Hardin, is furious when he discovers the massive secret she's been keeping. And rather than being understanding, he turns to sabotage.
                            Tessa knows Hardin loves her and will do anything to protect her, but there's a difference between loving someone and being able to have them in your life. 
                            This cycle of jealousy, unpredictable anger, and forgiveness is exhausting. She's never felt so intensely for anyone, so exhilarated by someone's kiss—but is the irrepressible heat between her and Hardin worth all the drama? 
                            Love used to be enough to hold them together. But if Tessa follows her heart now, will it be...the end?</td>

                        When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. 
                        So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father's dive bar... in Washington.
                        Piper hasn't even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won't last a week outside of Beverly Hills.

                        After almost—but not quite—dying, she's come up with six directives to help her “Get a Life”, 
                        and she's already completed the first: finally moving out of her glamourous family's mansion. The next items?
                        Enjoy a drunken night out. Ride a motorcycle. Go camping. Have meaningless but thoroughly enjoyable sex.
                        Travel the world with nothing but hand luggage. And... do something bad.
                        But it's not easy being bad, even when you've written step-by-step guidelines on how to do it correctly. 
                        What Chloe needs is a teacher, and she knows just the man for the job.
                        Redford 'Red' Morgan is a handyman with tattoos, a motorcycle, and more sex appeal than ten-thousand Hollywood heartthrobs. 
                        He's also an artist who paints at night and hides his work in the light of day, which Chloe knows because she spies on him occasionally. Just the teeniest, tiniest bit.
                        But when she enlists Red in her mission to rebel, she learns things about him that no spy session could teach her. 
                        Like why he clearly resents Chloe's wealthy background. And why he never shows his art to anyone. And what really lies beneath his rough exterior…</td>

                        But romance? Been there, done that, burned the T-shirt. Romantic partners, whatever their gender, are a distraction at best and a drain at worst. 
                        So Dani asks the universe for the perfect friend-with-benefits—someone who knows the score and knows their way around the bedroom.
                        When brooding security guard Zafir Ansari rescues Dani from a workplace fire drill gone wrong, it's an obvious sign: PhD student Dani and ex-rugby player Zaf are destined to sleep together. 
                        But before she can explain that fact, a video of the heroic rescue goes viral. Now half the internet is shipping #DrRugbae—and Zaf is begging Dani to play along. 
                        Turns out, his sports charity for kids could really use the publicity. Lying to help children? Who on earth would refuse?
                        Dani's plan is simple: fake a relationship in public, seduce Zaf behind the scenes. The trouble is, grumpy Zaf's secretly a hopeless romantic—and he's determined to corrupt Dani's stone-cold realism. 
                        Before long, he's tackling her fears into the dirt. But the former sports star has issues of his own, and the walls around his heart are as thick as his... um, thighs.
                        Suddenly, the easy lay Dani dreamed of is more complex than her thesis. Has her wish backfired? Is her focus being tested? Or is the universe just waiting for her to take a hint?</td>

                            Nora Stephens' life is books—she's read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. 
                            In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby.
                            Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters' trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, 
                            who she's convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, 
                            Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they've met many times and it's never been cute.
                            If Nora knows she's not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he's nobody's hero, 
                            but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they've written about themselves.</td>

                        In fifth grade, my teacher set us up with pen pals from a different school. 
                        Thinking I was a girl, with a name like Misha, the other teacher paired me up with her student, Ryen. My teacher, believing Ryen was a boy like me, agreed.
                        It didn't take long for us to figure out the mistake. And in no time at all, we were arguing about everything. The best take-out pizza. 
                        Android vs. iPhone. Whether or not Eminem is the greatest rapper ever… And that was the start. For the next seven years, it was us.
                        Her letters are always on black paper with silver writing. Sometimes there's one a week or three in a day, but I need them. 
                        She's the only one who keeps me on track, talks me down, and accepts everything I am.
                        We only had three rules. No social media, no phone numbers, no pictures. We had a good thing going. Why ruin it?
                        Until I run across a photo of a girl online. Name's Ryen, loves Gallo's pizza, and worships her iPhone. What are the chances?
                        F*ck it. I need to meet her. I just don't expect to hate what I find.
                        Ryen: He hasn't written in three months. Something's wrong. Did he die? Get arrested? Knowing Misha, neither would be a stretch.
                        Without him around, I'm going crazy. I need to know someone is listening. It's my own fault. I should've gotten his number or picture or something.
                        He could be gone forever. Or right under my nose, and I wouldn't even know it.</td>

                        Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral—viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress;

                        Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.</td>

                         — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation.

                         On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.</td>

                        Now, a body is found bearing all the disturbing hallmarks of that victim - and Pickering is missing. Did Cage free a brutal murderer?

                        His increasingly desperate search takes him back to the past, to a woman he never thought to see again, and down into a warren of lies and betrayals concealed beneath Holland Park mansions and the mean streets of Whitechapel

                        Because Poppy is the Chosen, the Blessed. The true ruler of Atlantia. She carries the blood of the King of Gods within her. By right the crown and the kingdom are hers.
                        The enemy and the warrior… Poppy has only ever wanted to control her own life, not the lives of others, but now she must choose to either forsake her birthright or seize the gilded crown and become the Queen of Flesh and Fire. 
                        But as the kingdoms' dark sins and blood-drenched secrets finally unravel, a long-forgotten power rises to pose a genuine threat. And they will stop at nothing to ensure that the crown never sits upon Poppy's head.
                        A lover and heartmate… But the greatest threat to them and to Atlantia is what awaits in the far west, where the Queen of Blood and Ash has her own plans, ones she has waited hundreds of years to carry out. 
                        Poppy and Casteel must consider the impossible—travel to the Lands of the Gods and wake the King himself. 
                        And as shocking secrets and the harshest betrayals come to light, and enemies emerge to threaten everything Poppy and Casteel have fought for, they will discover just how far they are willing to go for their people—and each other.
                        And now she will become Queen.</td>

                        In the West, Adaira struggles to adjust to the more brutal, bitter ways of life among the Breccans. Striving to find her place in the clan, 
                        she swiftly realizes that it just might be the last role she desires to hold. And while magic blooms effortlessly for the Breccans in the west, 
                        the spirits continue to suffer beneath Bane's harsh power, felt in every gust of wind.
                        In the East, Jack is adrift without Adaira until he sings to the ember-weak fire spirits, acquiring a dangerous mission he never expected. 
                        One that is destined to lead him westward. Likewise, Torin and Sidra are consumed by a new mystery as sickness spreads first amongst the crops, 
                        and then to the people of the Tamerlaine clan. While Sidra desperately searches for a cure, 
                        Torin dares to strike a bargain with the spirits--a precarious folly anytime, but especially now as the days grow darker.
                        With the island falling further out of balance, humans and spirits alike will need to join together to face Bane, 
                        and Jack's gift with the harp will be called upon once more. Yet no one can challenge the North Wind without paying a terrible price, 
                        and the sacrifice required this time may be more than Jack, Adaira, Torin, and Sidra can bear to pay.</td>

                        But when her sister is sold to the sadistic king of the Unseelie court to pay a debt, she'll do whatever it takes to get her back—including making a deal with the king himself to steal three magical relics from the Seelie court.
                        Gaining unfettered access to the Seelie court is easier said than done. Brie's only choice is to pose as a potential bride for Prince Ronan, and she soon finds herself falling for him.

                        and sitting together for hours in their special place, a rooftop overlooking the Yazdi skyline.

                        She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she's bisexual, she hasn't mustered the courage to tell her friends—not even her openly gay BFF, Simon.
                        So Leah really doesn't know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high. 
                        It's hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting—especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.</td>

                        She and her twin, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it's what got them through their mother leaving.
                        Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fanfiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere. 
                        Cath's sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can't let go. She doesn't want to. Now that they're going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. 
                        Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She's got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend; a fiction-writing professor who thinks fanfiction is the end of the civilized world; 
                        a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... and she can't stop worrying about her dad, who's loving and fragile and has never really been alone.
                        For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</td>

                        She loves her nerdy job at the historic Holland House, and when her super cute co-worker Nick asks her on a date, it feels like everything is falling into place.
                        But she soon learns the truth. Her family aren't just eccentric: they're monsters, with terrifying, hidden powers. 
                        And Nick isn't just a cute boy: he's a legendary monster slayer, who will do anything to bring them down.
                        As she battles Nick, Joan is forced to work with the beautiful and ruthless Aaron Oliver, heir to a monster family that hates her own.

                        Despite all of the odds, Joan achieved the impossible. She reset the timeline, saved her family, and destroyed the hero, Nick.
                        But her success has come at a terrible cost. She alone remembers what happened. Now, Aaron, her hard-won friend, and maybe more, is an enemy, trying to kill her. 
                        And Nick, the boy she loved, is a stranger who doesn't even know her name. Only Joan remembers that there is a ruthless and dangerous enemy still out there.
                        When a deadly attack forces Joan back into the monster world as a fugitive, she finds herself on the run with Nick, as Aaron closes in.
                        As the danger rises, and Nick gets perilously closer to discovering the truth of what Joan did to him, Joan discovers a secret of her own. One that threatens everyone she loves.
                        Torn between love and family and monstrous choices, Joan must find a way to re-gather her old allies to face down the deadliest of enemies, and to save the timeline itself.</td>

                        As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, 
                        while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, 
                        and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. 
                        Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.
                        In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, 
                        chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, 
                        to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, 
                        both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, 
                        Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</td>

                        Knox doesn't tolerate drama, even when it comes in the form of a stranded runaway bride.
                        Naomi wasn't just running away from her wedding. She was riding to the rescue of her estranged twin to Knockemout, Virginia, 
                        a rough-around-the-edges town where disputes are settled the old-fashioned way…with fists and beer. Usually in that order.
                        Too bad for Naomi her evil twin hasn't changed at all. After helping herself to Naomi's car and cash, Tina leaves her with something unexpected. 
                        The niece Naomi didn't know she had. Now she's stuck in town with no car, no job, no plan, and no home with an 11-year-old going on thirty to take care of.
                        There's a reason Knox doesn't do complications or high-maintenance women, especially not the romantic ones. But since Naomi's life imploded right in front of him, the least he can do is help her out of her jam. 
                        And just as soon as she stops getting into new trouble he can leave her alone and get back to his peaceful, solitary life.
                        At least, that's the plan until the trouble turns to real danger.</td>

                        Lucian Rollins is a lean, mean vengeance-seeking mogul. On a quest to erase his father's mark on the family name, he spends every waking minute pulling strings and building an indestructible empire. 
                        The more money and power he amasses, the safer he is from threats.
                        Except when it comes to the feisty small-town librarian that keeps him up at night…
                        Sloane Walton is a spitfire determined to carry on her father's quest for justice. She'll do that just as soon as she figures out exactly what the man she hates did to—or for—her family. 
                        Bonded by an old, dark secret from the past and the dislike they now share for each other, Sloane trusts Lucian about as far as she can throw his designer-suited body.
                        When bickering accidentally turns to foreplay, these two find themselves not quite regretting their steamy one-night stand. 
                        Once those flames are fanned, it seems impossible to put them out again. But with Sloane ready to start a family and Lucian refusing to even consider the idea of marriage and kids, these enemies-to-lovers are stuck at an impasse.
                        Broken men break women. It's what Lucian believes, what he's witnessed, and he's not going to take that chance with Sloane. 
                        He'd rather live a life of solitude than put her in danger. But he learns the hard way that leaving her means leaving her unprotected from other threats.
                        It's the second time he's ruthlessly cut her out of his life. There's no way she's going to give him a third chance. He's just going to have to make one for himself.</td>

                        Ze schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op de radio de minister van Onderwijs in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. 
                        Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. 
                        Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder meer dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen.
                        In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. 
                        De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis.</td>

                        But the night her loved ones' own safety is threatened by the Zoo's cruel master, Koffi unleashes a power she doesn't fully understand--and the consequences are dire.

                        But on the night of his final rite of passage, a fire upends his plans. In its midst, Ekon not only encounters the Shetani--a vicious monster that has plagued the city and his nightmares for nearly a century--but a curious girl who seems to have the power to ward off the beast. 
                        Koffi's power ultimately saves Ekon's life, but his choice to let her flee dooms his hopes of becoming a warrior.

                        In this book Laurie Bauer and Peter Trudgill have invited nineteen respected linguists from all over the world to address these "language myths"--showing that they vary from the misconceived to the downright wrong.
