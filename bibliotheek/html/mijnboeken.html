    <h1 class="mijn-boekenh1">Mijn bibliotheek</h1>

    <p>Officieel gesproken mag je boekenkasten met boeken thuis pas een bibliotheek noemen wanneer je 1000 boeken hebt thuis hebt.
        Ik vind het alleen gewoon leuker om mijn boeken een bibliotheek te noemen, mijn moeder leent ook boeken van mij en ik van haar,
        dus dat ik ook eigenlijk een bibliotheek. Mijn moeder en ik hebben wel samen een bibliotheek samen. Hieronder staan al mijn boeken die ik heb.

                        But when you're smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don't bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.

                        Hidden deep in the mountains of Colorado lies the Inn at Havenfall, a sanctuary that connects ancient worlds—each with its own magic. 
                        For generations, the inn has protected all who seek refuge within its walls, and any who disrupt the peace can never return.
                        For Maddie Morrow, summers at the inn are more than a chance to experience this magic firsthand. Havenfall is an escape from reality, where her mother sits on death row accused of murdering Maddie's brother. 
                        It's where Maddie fell in love with handsome Fiorden soldier Brekken. And it's where one day she hopes to inherit the role of Innkeeper from her beloved uncle.
                        But this summer, the impossible happens—a dead body is found, shattering everything the inn stands for. 
                        With Brekken missing, her uncle gravely injured, and a dangerous creature on the loose, Maddie suddenly finds herself responsible for the safety of everyone in Havenfall. 
                        She'll do anything to uncover the truth, even if it means working together with an alluring new staffer, Taya, who seems to know more than she's letting on. 
                        As dark secrets are revealed about the inn itself, one thing becomes clear to Maddie—no one can be trusted, and no one is safe...</td>

                        And these magical objects come with their own terrible secret: the sisters' family is haunted by a generations-long curse that prevents them from ever leaving their island--at the cost of death.
                        The sisters set out to break the curse and free their family forever. But after stumbling upon a mysterious prisoner who claims to be able to help them, they find themselves in great danger. 
                        And in order to break the curse--and stay alive--they must unravel a mystery that goes back centuries, one that involves shipwrecks, smugglers, and sorcery of the most perilous kind.</td>

                        But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? 
                        If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. 
                        But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go — especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. 
                        And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.
                        To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is, what is he trying to do? 
                        When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. 
                        How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?</td>

                        When her father is accused of a terrible crime, she and her brother travel to London in hopes of preventing the family's ruin. 
                        Cordelia's mother wants to marry her off, but Cordelia is determined to be a hero rather than a bride. 
                        Soon Cordelia encounters childhood friends James and Lucie Herondale and is drawn into their world of glittering ballrooms, secret assignations, and supernatural salons, where vampires and warlocks mingle with mermaids and magicians. 
                        All the while, she must hide her secret love for James, who is sworn to marry someone else.
                        But Cordelia's new life is blown apart when a shocking series of demon attacks devastate London. 
                        These monsters are nothing like those Shadowhunters have fought before—these demons walk in daylight, strike down the unwary with incurable poison, and seem impossible to kill. 
                        London is immediately quarantined. Trapped in the city, Cordelia's friends discover that a dark legacy has gifted them with incredible powers—and forced a brutal choice that will reveal the true cruel price of being a hero.</td>

                        Even worse, she is now bound to an ancient demon, Lilith, stripping her of her power as a Shadowhunter.
                        After fleeing to Paris with Matthew Fairchild, Cordelia hopes to forget her sorrows in the city's glittering nightlife. 
                        But reality intrudes when shocking news comes from home: Tatiana Blackthorn has escaped the Adamant Citadel, and London is under new threat by the Prince of Hell, Belial.
                        Cordelia returns to a London riven by chaos and dissent. The long-kept secret that Belial is James and Lucie's grandfather has been revealed by an unexpected enemy, and the Herondales find themselves under suspicion of dealings with demons. 
                        Cordelia longs to protect James but is torn between a love for James she has long believed hopeless, and the possibility of a new life with Matthew.

                        Left alone in a shadowy London, they must face Belial's deadly army. 
                        If Cordelia and her friends are going to save their city—and their families—they will have to muster their courage, swallow their pride, and trust one another again.
